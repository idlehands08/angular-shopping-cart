# ShoppingCart

This project was created by Geoffrey Dagamac using Angular, ExpressJS, and MongoDB for demo purposes of these tech stacks only.  

## Instructions

Start ExpressJS server by navigating to shopping-cart-expressjs folder through the terminal. Run `npm start`. 
Once ExpressJS server is started, using another terminal, navigate to shopping-cart folder. Run `ng server`.
Using a web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The demo shopping web page should be displayed. You will see a sample product list which was fetched from a Cloud MongoDB.
Click add on the add to cart button on any of the items and the cart component on the right will be updated.
